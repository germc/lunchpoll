Friday Lunch Poll
=========

Our aim is to create the best online polling and chat system the Friday lunch has ever seen.

##Suggested Features

###User Facing
* Login or Create Account
* Add Restaurant to Eat
	* From History
	* New Restaurant
* Vote up (maybe even down) an existing restaurant
* See real-time restaurant standings
	* We could do some pretty cool designs with showing a currently *winning* restaurant 
* Weekly thread discussion of lunch plans
	* Facebook-thread-ish?

### Misc Features
* **Potentially out of scope but super cool**: A way to organize rides. A user could declare the building they are in, number of seats they have, and join up with others for rides.
* Create the discussion thread weekly around 11:00 a.m.?
* Push notification when the deadline has been reached and maybe even send out an email to the group?
